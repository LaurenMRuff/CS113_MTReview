     - Stacks are one of the most commonly used data structures in CS
    - What is a Stack?
        ~ LIFO : last in first out
            = items are added to the top
            = items are also accessed from the time
            = only one item cna be accessed at a time; it is the only visible one
    - Stack methods:
        ~ empty() : returns if the stack is empty
        ~ peek() : returns object at the top of the stack, does not remove it
        ~ pop() : returns the object at the top of the stack, removes it
            = attempting to pop an empty stack throws a EmptyStackException
        ~ push(E obj) : pushes an item onto the stack and returns the item that was pushed
    - * see stack application in L5CodeStack.java
